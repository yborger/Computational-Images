# Assignment 3: Recursive 2D Geometry

**DUE February 19th at 11:59 PM**

In this lab, we will explore 2D geometry and learn how to use matrix
multiplication to perform scaling, rotation and translation.  Also
we'll learn about the wondrous world of [recursive functional
drawing](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/257577/1/funcgeo2.pdf) ala
[M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) and Peter
Henderson.

I've included the
[`fish.csv`](https://github.com/micahhahn/FunctionalGeometry/blob/master/src/Geometry.hs)
file that includes the curve needed for our basic fish. I've also
created functions that load in the data and display it
(`drawCurve`). Your job is to implement the stub methods (marked `TODO`)
to make the final Escher artwork a reality.


## Tasks

1. `vscale(v: p5.Vector, sx: float, sy: float): p5.Vector` 

   - for now just return a new `p5.Vector` with the `x` and `y`
   components scaled (i.e., multiplied) by the `sx` and `sy`
   parameters. 
   
   **NOTE**: `drawCurve` will not seem to work until you complete this
   step (the curves are too tiny!)

![color `drawCurve(fish)`](imgs/1.png) 
![color](imgs/p.png) 

For example, it can be used to transform all the coordinates in the curves. 

```javascript
function applyT(curves, t) {
  let newImg = [];
  for (let line of curves) {
    let newline = line.map(t);
    newImg.push(newline);
  }
  return newImg;
}

function shrink(curves) {
  return applyT(curves, (v) => vscale(v, 0.2, 0.2));
}

drawCurve(shrink(fish));
```

Pressing `p` should test this function.

2. `transform(v: p5.Vector: matrix: list): p5.Vector`

   - This function should take a *inhomogenous* vector `v`: $(x,y)$, turn
   it into an augmented vector $(x, y, 1)$ and multiply it by the
   provided `matrix`. You should return the result again as an
   *inhomogenous* vector $(x/w, y/w)$.  I suggest storing the `matrix`
   as a list of `p5.Vectors` allowing you to use the `dot()` method,
   but it is up to you. More info
   [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/matrix-representation-of-geometric-transformations.html)
   on geometric transformations as matrices.


3. Revise `vscale(v: p5.Vector, sx: float, sy:float): p5.Vector`

   - This should now use your `transform` method. 
   
   $$\begin{bmatrix}
    s_x  & 0 & 0\\
    0  & s_y & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      v.x\\
      v.y\\
      1
     \end{bmatrix}$$

4. `vtranslate (v: p5.Vector, x:float, y:float): p5.Vector`

  - This should use the your `transform` method. Pressing `k` should test this function.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & t_x\\
0 & 1 & t_y\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
v.x\\
v.y\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

5. `vrotate (v: p5.Vector, a:degrees): p5.Vector` 

   - This should use your `transform` method. 
   
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0\\
\sin \theta  & \cos \theta & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
v.x\\
v.y\\
1
\end{bmatrix}$$
	
   - Or adding in the translation bits: 
   
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & t_x\\
    \sin \theta  & \cos \theta & t_y\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      v.x\\
      v.y\\
      1
     \end{bmatrix}$$

   - And finally adding in the translation, rotation, and scale:
   
   $$\begin{bmatrix}
    s_x \cos \theta & -s_y \sin \theta & t_x s_x \cos \theta\ - t_y s_y \sin \theta\\
    s_x \sin \theta  &  s_y \cos \theta & t_x s_x \sin \theta + t_y s_y \cos \theta\\
    0 & 0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
      v.x\\
      v.y\\
      1
     \end{bmatrix}$$


6. `flip(curve: [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]): [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]`.  Pressing `f` should test this function.

![`flip(fish)`](imgs/f.png) 

7. `rot(curve: [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]): [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]` rotates curves by -90 degees. Pressing `r` should test this function.

![`rot(fish)`](imgs/r.png) 

8. `rot45(curve: [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]): [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]` rotates curves by 45 degrees, shrinks & shifts. Pressing `s` should test this function.

![`flip(rot45(fish))`](imgs/s.png) 

9. `above(top, bottom, top_proportion, bottom_prop): [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]`. Pressing `a` should test this function.

![`above(fish, fish)`](imgs/a.png) 

10. `beside(left, right, left_proportion, right_prop): [[4 p5.Vectors] ...]`. Pressing `b` should test this function.

![`beside(fish, fish, 2/5, 3/5)`](imgs/d.png) 

11. `corner` and `side` are already complete, but here are images to
    help in debugging the other functions. The images are zoomed out
    a little (changed `sc` in `drawCurve`) to better see what's going
    on.

```
t= over(fish, over(smallfish, rot(rot(rot(smallfish)))))
u = over(over(over(smallfish, rot(smallfish)), rot(rot(smallfish))), rot(rot(rot(smallfish))))
```

![`corner(2, t, u)`](imgs/c.png) 
![`side(2, t, u)`](imgs/v.png) 
![`t`](imgs/t.png) 
![`u`](imgs/u.png) 


## Challenge Problem

- Build some other graphical pattern using this method. More info [here](https://mapio.github.io/programming-with-escher/).

## Learning Objectives

- use the [`p5.Vector`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector) library
- use homogeneous coordinates
- perform matrix multiplication for 2D geometric transformations
- implement matrix multiplication
- procedurally generate graphics recursively


## Deliverables

1. Commit the javascript `sketch.js` to the repo. Your sketch should
   use [`key`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/key) to toggle between
   the different ways of viewing the graphics.

2. Write a small reflection (as a markdown document named
   `reflection.md`) about what you were able to accomplish in this
   lab. Don't forget the collaboration statement!
