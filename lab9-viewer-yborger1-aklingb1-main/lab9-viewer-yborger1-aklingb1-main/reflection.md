In this lab, we were able to write code that parses a set of 3d coordinates into something viewable on a 2d surface like a computer screen. We were able to take the values determined by the user's mouse input and feed them through a chain of transformation matrices to produce an output projection, using either perspective or orthographic view. It was really interesting to see it come together like this; creating a full 3d projection seemed far outside the realm of possiblity with the programming skills we came into the class with, but it feels like everything we learned about homographies put together made it possible somehow.

Collaboration statement: We (Yael and Addie) worked together on this lab, and received no information from outside sources other than our boy Keith.
