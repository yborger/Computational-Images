# Assignment 12: Projection

**DUE April 29th at 11:59 PM**

In this lab we will project one of our sketches from this semester
onto the real world. We'll use the
[`p5.projection`](https://github.com/osresearch/p5.projection/)
library to transform one of our sketches for a custom projection
surface.

## Tasks

- Pick one of the previous labs and project it onto two custom projection planes (and show Keith).
- Report the homographies of the projection surfaces (inspect `mat.mat`). 
- Work on your final project!

## Challenge Problem

Use [`p5.mapper`](https://github.com/jdeboi/p5.mapper) to project onto multiple surfaces at once.

## Learning Objectives

- project onto the real world
- use homographies for keystone correction
- use `p5.js's` [`applyMatrix`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/applyMatrix) 


## Deliverables

1. Add your code to `sketch.js`.

2. Write about what you were able to accomplish and report your
   various homographies in the reflection (as a
   markdown document named `reflection.md`).
