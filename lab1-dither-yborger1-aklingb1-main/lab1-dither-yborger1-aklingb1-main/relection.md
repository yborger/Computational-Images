Collaboration statement: Yael and I worked only with each other, using only lab documents and P5JS documentation
for internet resources.

We were surprised at how easy a lot of these felt to implement. There were a couple of funny roadblocks; for instance,
when creating a grayscale image, we accidentally read data from the new blank image into itself instead of reading it
from the camera feed into the new image, a mistake so glaringly obvious that neither us nor our dear professor even
thought to check for it, leaving us stumped for hours. Or later, when we implemented our dithering effect, it flickered
between black and white values so quickly and effectively we were briefly convinced we had failed and there were actual
intermediate greys where they shouldn't be. Overall, though, it was quite fun to perform some relatively simply
transformations on our image (well, maybe not floyd-steinberg dithering, that's pretty complicated) and see immediate
results.
