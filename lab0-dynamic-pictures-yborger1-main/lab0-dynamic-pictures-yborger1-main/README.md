# Assignment 0: Dynamic Pictures

*DUE January 29th at 11:55 PM*

**Use [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/) to create a [Dynamic Picture](http://worrydream.com/DynamicPicturesMotivation/), ala Bret Victor.**

The first thing you should do is go take a picture of something real
in the science center (or outside) with your phone. This image will
serve as the background for your dynamic picture. Next, you will add
[graphical
components](https://p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)
on top of this picture to make it dynamic. Our first journey into
augmented reality.

## Getting started with p5.js

Your repository already has the necessary starter code, but it is
still a good idea to walk through the [*Getting
Started*](https://p5js.org/get-started/) and the
[*overview*](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview)
tutorials. Specifically, how to get `p5.js` [working
locally](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) with
any editor. For this lab, I ask you use Visual Studio Code, and
install the [Live
Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
and
[`p5.vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode)
extensions. If you really want to use another editor you can use
`python3 -m http.server` in the sketch folder instead.


## Dynamic Pictures

Write in file `reflection.md` about what you hope to accomplish with
your dynamic picture: what are you trying to explain (e.g., a
scientific idea, a political ideology), express (e.g., an emotion,
passage of time, season of the year) or explore (e.g., economics
simulation, poker). If you are having a hard time thinking of an idea,
I suggest you create a
[clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html), but be creative!
Specifically, think about how the static, static animation, dynamic &
interactive aspects of the sketch help you make your point. Be sure to
chat with your instructor about your dynamic picture plan (during the
lab period) before you start implementing it.

Next, realize your dynamic picture as a processing sketch in
Javascript. Be sure to indicate using comments the pieces of your
program that realize the static, static animation, dynamic &
interactive aspects of your dynamic picture plan (part 0). Use your
[image](https://p5js.org/examples/image-load-and-display-image.html)
as part of the static component. Consider using the
[date](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/day),
[time](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/hour),
[timers](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis) or the [simple
physics](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-animation.html) for the
static animation part, and [randomness](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) for the dynamic bits. You can
use the [mouse](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX) and
[keyboard](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed) for the
[interactive](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html) pieces. When
you are finished add another paragraph in reflection about what you
accomplished. Finally, add a collaboration statement to the top of the
`reflection.md` file.


## Learning Objectives

- introduce `p5.js`;
- learn how to load and draw images;
- explore Processing's graphics primitives;
- employ Victor's idea of Dynamic Pictures; 
- augment reality.
