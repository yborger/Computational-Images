In this lab, we were able to separate the foreground of an image from the background in four different ways, and display them all side-by-side for simultaneous comparison. It was interesting to see the differences in all the different methods; it struck me that it was less a case of one being strictly better than the others, and moreso that each of them had different strengths for different potential applications. That being said, calculating based on the gaussian probability distribution proved finicky; using print statements I was able to verify that the running standard deviation calculation did correlate with how much each pixel was changing on average, which was pretty neat to see in action, but the end result tended to be a bit all-over-the-place in what it chose to let through. I lacked a nearby parking lot to point the camera at while testing it, so I can't say for certain whether we replicated the effect we saw in lab.

Collaboration statement; Yael and I (Addie) worked only with each other on this lab, and used no other outside resources other than office hours. We started it together, and then I finished it while Yael took charge on Hough.
