We were able to implement a threshold function using fragment shaders and compare its framerate to our previous threshold function from lab 1 that iterated over the pixels one-by-one. We found that our previous function averaged around 15 fps, whereas the shader managed about 60. That's about a 400% performance increase, which we were quite impressed by.
