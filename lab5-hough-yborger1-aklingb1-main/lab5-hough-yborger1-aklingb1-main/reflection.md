The two map calls essentially convert the given variable into the correct range. They are both overall readjusting the variable given into the proper range (resizing the variable). The first map() call takes every angle "ti" in the range [0, ntheta] and converts the angle into radians, since the new range is [0, 2*PI]. The second map() call is (rounded) the line drawn, "rho," converted from the range of the canvas to the range [0, nhro].
We do not need to bound-check "ti" because it is the counting variable of the for-loop and therefore has a pre-set bound. On the other hand, "r" has a conversion (the second map() function) that must remain within the designated area rather than expand out of it into the main canvas. For that reason, "r" must have a bound-check.

Also, we added a "weird_hough.png" file because we had an interesting thing happen when bug-fixing, which is that the line plotted actually crosses exactly where it is needed, but it is not the intended spot to be drawing that line. Thought it was quite funny.
